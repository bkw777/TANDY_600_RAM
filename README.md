# History / Credits

* 20210811 Made Jayeson's original KiCad files more portable and self-contained. Added 3d models. Added 000_LOCAL schemtic and footprint libraries, copied all compnents and footprints and updated all references so the files are self-contained. Massaged the PCB layout and silkscreen. The circuit is still the original circuit electrically.  

Based on Model600Sram_v1.1 by Jayeson Lee-Steere (See git branch "JLS-1.1").  

2017 Jan 04 - I asked on the Tandy Color Computer Facebook group if anyone could clone the 96K ram board for Model 600, and Jayeson Lee-Steere did so. I sent him an original module to examine, and he produced Model600Sram_v1.1 and placed it in the public domain.
