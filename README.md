# SRAM modules for TANDY 600

There are several versions to choose from. They all work the same. Just pick whichever you like based on size, cost of parts, ease of soldering, ease of installing, etc.

[Surface-Mount single-bank 96K](#standard-version) easy to solder, polarity keyed, more expensive  
[Through-Hole single-bank 96K](#through-hole-version) same as above, plus socketable/removable chips  
[Tiny single-bank 96K](#tiny-version) more difficult to solder, miniaturized mostly just as a stunt  
[Tiny dual-bank 192K](#dual-version) most practical way to get all 192K if you can manage the soldering

## Through-Hole Version  

Same schematic as the standard version, just with all through-hole components.  
The ICs may be socketed or not as you wish. When installed in the 600 there is room for both IC's on both boards to be socketed, and the BOM includes sockets.

# History / Credits

In 2017 I asked on the Tandy Color Computer Facebook group [if anyone could clone a 96K ram board for Model 600](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/permalink/10154864662292641/), and Jayeson Lee-Steere produced [Model600Sram_v1.1](https://github.com/bkw777/TANDY_600_RAM/tree/JLS-1.1) and placed it in the public domain.  

This version is different now but started from that.
