# History / Credits

* 20210812 Removed the 74HC08

* 20210811 Made the original KiCad files more portable and self-contained. Added 3d models. Added project local symbol and footprint libraries and moved all symbols & footprints and to it. Massaged the PCB layout and silkscreen. The circuit is still the original circuit electrically.

* 20170104 - I asked on the Tandy Color Computer Facebook group if anyone could clone the 96K ram board for Model 600, and Jayeson Lee-Steere did so. I sent him an original module to examine, and he produced Model600Sram_v1.1 and placed it in the public domain.
