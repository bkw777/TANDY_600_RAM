## DUAL VERSION

Single board that plugs into both CN1 and CN2 and supplies all 192K at once.

## DUAL_full Version

This is the same as the DUAL version, just with the full connectors for polarity enforcement.  
The pcb is larger to match the connectors, and a few traces are moved slightly to take advantage of the larger pcb for better ground paths and fewer vias needed.

# History / Credits

In 2017 I asked on the Tandy Color Computer Facebook group [if anyone could clone a 96K ram board for Model 600](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/permalink/10154864662292641/), and Jayeson Lee-Steere produced [Model600Sram_v1.1](https://github.com/bkw777/TANDY_600_RAM/tree/JLS-1.1) and placed it in the public domain.  

This version is different now but started from that.
